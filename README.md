## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a solo entrepreneur based in Europe, and also an author and contributor to open source projects as well as a committer at the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/).

Previously, I joined [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/) in 2015 as their first product manager, and helped build and grow their product and culture over six years, from eight employees all the way to 2,400.
