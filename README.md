## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a solo entrepreneur based in Europe. I am also an author and contributor of
open source projects, and a committer at the [Apache Software
Foundation](https://www.apache.org/).

Previously, I joined [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/) in 2015 as their
first product manager, and helped build and grow their products and culture over
six years, from eight employees all the way to 2,400 and IPO on Nasdaq.
